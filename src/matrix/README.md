# S21_Matrix

## General info 

Implementation of matrices processing library in C. 

## Goal & requirements

The goal of this project was to become familiar with major matrices processing routines and
implement them. The library had to be covered with unit-tests using Check framework.

## Key learnings
- Got familiar with basic matrices processing functions & their implementation
- Became more confident with using recursion (used for `determinant`, `calc_complements`, `inverse_matrix`)
- Discovered [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) & used it for testing my functions
- Tried out Python & [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) for testing correctness of my calculations
